**``Software Engineering Student/ Game Developer``**

I'm an indie software and game developer with a dream of leading a team. For me, coding isn't just about solving problems, but also about connecting, understanding needs, and creating experiences.

With a naturally creative mind, I'm constantly creating new projects and adding new features. However, in a world where technology can be a powerful tool, a lack of compassion and care creates barriers, isolates people, and distances us from the true human potential of innovation.

So my focus goes beyond solving problems. **My focus is on people.**
